Maestro, the music platform that makes it effortless to find songs in new genres.

## About
This was a project for CSCE 445 - Computers and New Media with Dr. Frank Shipman at Texas A&M University. Needless to say, it's not as robust as we would have liked it.

### The Big Idea

Our inital goal was to create a web application that suggested classical pieces based on a user’s individual music preferences - however, we broadened this scope to encompass all available genres on Spotify.

### Goals
- Acquire playlist information
- Analyze quantitative characteristics (mood, tempo, danceability, timbre, etc.) of songs in playlist
- Provide classical recommendations based on an assessment of the playlist’s musical qualities

### Issues
- Media Issues
  * Will the viewer be able to stream music from our platform?
  * Will we be able to create a successful recommendation model with given datasets and tools/API’s? (Spotify, etc)
  * Are there parameters that skew results? 
- Cognitive Issues
  * Do the recommendations make sense?
  * Are the results displayed in an effective manner?
  * Will the recommendations be useful to user? (feedback)
- Social Issues
  * Are there vulnerabilities that can allow for interference by other people?
  * Are users willing to share their playlist information?
  * Is user information secure (account info)?
